# airfoil-cfd-dim-reduction
This project focuses on performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data of steady airfoil flow fields. The goal is to achieve dimensionality reduction to simplify the analysis and visualization of complex flow patterns around airfoils.
